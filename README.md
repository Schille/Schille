### Hi! 👋 I am Michael.

I am a software engineer and business director from Germany. :de:

I currently live and work in Munich 🍺. In 2014, I founded [Blueshoe](https://blueshoe.de), the cloud-native development company. 🚀
We're creating a bunch of open-source software projects 💙:
- [Unikube](https://github.com/unikubehq/): the most convenient development platform for Kubernetes-based application development
- [Gefyra](https://github.com/gefyrahq/gefyra): a standalone tool to write and debug container-based software directly within a Kubernetes cluster
- [Getdeck](https://github.com/Getdeck/getdeck): a standalone tool to create reproducible Kubernetes cluster and a Kubernetes-in-Kubernetes solution
- [Django-Hurricane](https://github.com/django-hurricane/): the Kubernetes native stack specifically created for [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [Others](https://github.com/Blueshoe/): different software packages for Django and others  

If one of these products is of interest for you, don't hesitate and get in touch. In addition, we're providing software development services,
team training and consultancy. :nerd_face:

As a software developer I am highly interested in all things Kubernetes and making Kubernetes a convenient and accessible software development platform.  
I like Python, Linux, Django, container and scalable technologies as well as charming software architectures. 🔭 

In my free time I like brewing beer, all types of cycling (especially MTB and road), playing the keyboard and being away in my self-made campervan. I am husband and father of one. ❤️
